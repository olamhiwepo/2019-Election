# Introduction
The 2023 Election is something that sparked huge interest in the nation across different age groups and tribes. The Election was very unique because
for the first time Nigeria was going to have  3 strong political parties contesting aside from the regular 2 big wigs.
As a data analyst, i thought to myself "could the voting pattern in hte 2019 election be a pointer to what the 2023 elections will look like?" so i decided to analyze the 2019 National Election data

# Problem statement
- what are the top 5 states that voted for APC
- what are the top 5 states that voted for PDP
- What is the total number of votes per region
- what is the percentage of vote by political parties

# Data sourcing
i downloaded a pictorial of the results of the election from the internet and then typed it in an excel sheet

# Data modelling
modelling wasn't needed because the data has just one table

# Analysis and visualization

here, we received the folllowing insights
- The NorthWest has the highest amount of voting population. 4 out of of the 5 states with the highest voting numbers are from the NorthWest
- NorthWest and NorthEast were strong points of APC and helped them get a good lead in the Election
- Both PDP and APC have a total of 92.5% of the total votes
- Lagos is the only state in the South with enough voting numbers to compete with the North
- PDP has  a good presence in the SouthSouth but the small voting population of the region doesn't favour PDP

 # Conlusion and Recommendations
 - PDP needs to work on building their voting strength in regions with the highest numbers of voting population
 - APC needs a good strategy on infiltrating the southSouth and SouthEast
 - only a political revolution can cause the emergence of a 3rd strong political party
