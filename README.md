# Introduction
The 2023 Election is something that sparked huge intrest in the nation across different age groups and tribes. The Election was very unique because
for the first time Nigeria was going to have  3 strong political parties contesting aside from the regular 2 big wigs.
As a data analyst, i thought to myself "could the voting pattern in hte 2019 election be a pointer to what the 2023 elections will look like?" so i decided to analyze the 2019 National Election data

# Problem statement
- what are the top 5 states that voted for APC
- what are the top 5 states that voted for PDP
- What is the total number of votes per region
- what is the percentage of vote by political parties

# Data sourcing
i downloaded a pictorial of the results of the election from the internet and then typed it in an excel sheet

# Data modelling
modelling wasn't needed because the data has just one table

# Analysis and visualization
