# Introduction
The 2023 Election is something that sparked huge intrest in the nation across different age groups and tribes. The Election was very unique because
for the first time Nigeria was going to have  3 strong political parties contesting aside from the regular 2 big wigs.
As a data analyst, i thought to myself "could the voting pattern in hte 2019 election be a pointer to what the 2023 elections will look like?" so i decided to analyze the 2019 National Election data
